ALTERNATIVELY, DUCTILITY IS A MEASURE OF A MATERIAL?S ABILITY TO BEND, STRETCH OR SPREAD WITHOUT BREAKING INTO PIECES. OFTEN, INCREASING THE STRENGTH OF A MATERIAL RESULTS IN A DECREASE OF DUCTILITY AND VICE VERSA. THIS PROJECT SUPPORTS FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FOCUSED ON THE DESIGN OF TITANIUM ALLOYS THAT OVERCOME THIS TYPICAL STRENGTH-TO-DUCTILITY TRADE-OFF BY CAREFULLY TAILORING THE ELEMENTAL MAKE-UP OF SAID ALLOYS. THIS CAREFUL TAILORING CONTROLS HOW SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE METAL ARE ARRANGED ON AN ATOMIC LEVEL TO HAVE A CERTAIN CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND ARRANGEMENT THAT INCREASES THE MATERIAL?S STRENGTH WITHOUT REDUCING THE MATERIAL?S OVERALL ABILITY TO BEND OR STRETCH. THIS TYPE OF DESIGN IS KNOWN AS METASTABILITY ENGINEERING. THIS PROJECT INVESTIGATES HOW PARTS OF TITANIUM ALLOYS HAVING THE SAME ELEMENTAL MAKEUP AND ATOMIC STRUCTURE CHANGE WITH BOTH TEMPERATURE AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND HOW THEY DEFORM UNDER VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. TO EXPLORE THIS BEHAVIOR, REAL-TIME AND ?AFTER THE FACT? STUDIES ARE PERFORMED USING CUTTING EDGE EQUIPMENT TO DISCOVER CONNECTIONS BETWEEN LOCAL CHEMISTRY, DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS AND VERY SMALL PARTICLES IN THE METAL THAT ARE NANOMETERS IN SIZE AND HAVE ONLY RECENTLY BEEN DISCOVERED IN TITANIUM. THE FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE ESTABLISHED IN THIS PROJECT ADVANCES THE ABILITY TO DESIGN LIGHTWEIGHT TITANIUM ALLOYS WITH BOTH HIGH STRENGTH AND HIGH DUCTILITY. METASTABLE TITANIUM ALLOYS ARE DESIRABLE FOR AEROSPACE, AUTOMOBILE, BIO-MEDICAL AND CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, DUE TO THEIR HIGH STRENGTH-TO-WEIGHT RATIO, ABILITY TO ABSORB IMPACT, RESISTANCE TO CHEMICAL DETERIORATION AND COMPATIBILITY WITH BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS. AS AN EXAMPLE, RELATIVE TO JUST ONE OF THESE INDUSTRIES, IMPROVEMENTS TO THESE ALLOYS CAN HELP TO INCREASE AIRCRAFT FUEL EFFICIENCY, REDUCE FUEL CONSUMPTION, LOWER CARBON EMISSIONS AND ULTIMATELY, BENEFIT THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS PROJECT ALSO DEVELOPS EDUCATION MODULES FOR STUDENTS IN A K-12 SUMMER CAMP AS WELL AS LAB EXPERIENCES FOR UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA RENO. BOTH SETS OF ACTIVITIES FEATURE HIGH POWERED MICROSCOPES PROVIDING STUDENTS FROM LOCAL RENO COMMUNITIES EXPOSURE TO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WHILE ALSO PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES TO LEARN MATERIALS SCIENCE FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING THE FUTURE SCIENTIFIC WORKFORCE. TECHNICAL SUMMARY THIS PROJECT AIMS TO ADVANCE A NOVEL ALLOY DESIGNING STRATEGY KNOWN AS METASTABILITY ENGINEERING, BY STUDYING MICROSTRUCTURAL EVOLUTION AND DEFORMATION IN METASTABLE TITANIUM ALLOYS. THE PROJECT WILL IDENTIFY THE CRITICAL ROLE OF THE RECENTLY DISCOVERED, ORTHORHOMBIC NANO-PRECIPITATE, O PRIME (O?) IN THE SPATIALLY CONFINED PHASE TRANSFORMATIONS OF TITANIUM AND ITS ALLOYS. ADVANCED EX-SITU AND IN-SITU CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES ARE EMPLOYED TO EXPLORE THREE SPECIFIC PHENOMENA: (I) THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALLOY COMPOSITION AND O? NANO-PRECIPITATES; (II) THE ROLE OF O? IN REFINING PRECIPITATE MICROSTRUCTURE; AND (III) THE ROLE OF O? IN REGULATING MARTENSITIC TRANSFORMATIONS. MULTISCALE EX- AND IN-SITU EXPERIMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION USING SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, SCANNING TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AND ATOM PROBE TOMOGRAPHY ARE USED. THIS RESEARCH PROGRESSES THE ABILITY TO REALIZE METASTABLE ALLOYS OF TITANIUM HAVING BOTH HIGH STRENGTH AND HIGH DUCTILITY. EDUCATION MODULES AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES FOCUSED ON ELECTRON MICROSCOPY CREATIVELY ENGAGE STUDENTS IN K-12, UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE LEVEL STUDY. THE EDUCATION MODULES AND ACTIVITIES ARE ENHANCED BY A REMOTE-CONTROLLED TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPE AND A PORTABLE DESKTOP SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE TO CAPTURE A WIDE RANGE OF INTERESTS AND EXPOSE ALL TO MEANINGFUL SCIENCE.

THIS PROJECT AIMS TO SERVE THE NATIONAL INTEREST BY REMEDIATING RACIAL, GENDER, AND CLASS TRACKING IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE MATH IN ORDER TO ADVANCE OPPORTUNITY AND EQUITY IN STEM PARTICIPATION. AS COMMUNITY COLLEGES AROUND THE COUNTRY MOVE TOWARDS ELIMINATING DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION, STUDENTS ARE INCREASINGLY ELIGIBLE TO TAKE A COLLEGE-LEVEL STATISTICS / LIBERAL ARTS MATH (SLAM) OR BUSINESS AND SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATH (BSTEM) COURSE. WHILE DIRECT ACCESS TO COLLEGE-LEVEL SLAM OR BSTEM COURSES REDUCES OBSTACLES TO THE COMPLETION OF DEGREE AND TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS, HAVING BOTH OPTIONS COULD TURN THESE COLLEGE-LEVEL MATH PATHWAYS INTO POTENTIALLY RIGID MATH TRACKS. THIS COULD HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR STEM PARTICIPATION. THE PROJECT WILL BEGIN BY EVALUATING THE EXTENT TO WHICH STUDENTS ARE TRACKED INTO SLAM AND BSTEM PATHWAYS ALONG RACIAL/ETHNIC, GENDER, FIRST GENERATION STATUS, AND FAMILY INCOME LINES. THEN, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH A SINGLE COMMUNITY COLLEGE, PROJECT COLLABORATORS PLAN TO DESIGN, IMPLEMENT, AND EVALUATE A LOW-TOUCH NUDGE THAT ENCOURAGES STUDENTS IN COLLEGE STATISTICS TO MEET WITH A MATH INSTRUCTOR OR COUNSELOR TO ?WARM UP? THEIR STEM ASPIRATIONS, AND INVITES THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN A WEEK-LONG, NON-CREDIT INTERSESSION BRIDGE2BSTEM WORKSHOP. THE WORKSHOP WILL PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE THEIR STEM INTERESTS, LEARN ABOUT STEM CAREERS, ESTABLISH A GROWTH MINDSET TOWARDS MATH, AND RECEIVE ACADEMIC SUPPORT FOR SWITCHING TO BSTEM COURSES. EMERGING FROM THIS PROJECT WILL BE NEW KNOWLEDGE ON WHETHER OFFERING SLAM COURSES MAY INADVERTENTLY TRACK RACIALLY MINORITIZED STUDENTS AND WOMEN OUT OF STEM FIELDS; CAUSAL EVIDENCE ON THE POTENTIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF NUDGING STUDENTS TO EXPLORE THEIR STEM INTERESTS; AND A MODEL FOR A STATISTICS-TO-STEM BRIDGE EXPERIENCE THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE MATH DEPARTMENTS CAN ADOPT. THIS PROJECT WILL PURSUE A MULTI-STAGED EFFORT WITH A LARGE URBAN COMMUNITY DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA TO: 1) DOCUMENT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THERE IS TRACKING OF STUDENTS INTO BSTEM AND SLAM COURSE SEQUENCES, 2) COLLABORATE WITH THE MATH AND COUNSELING FACULTY AT A SINGLE HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTION TO DEVELOP A BRIDGE2BSTEM WORKSHOP DESIGNED TO INTRODUCE STUDENTS TO STEM CAREERS, CONNECT THEM TO SUPPORT SERVICES, AND TO LEARN FROM PEERS IN THE BSTEM PATHWAY ABOUT WAYS OF EXPLORING AND DEVELOPING CAREERS IN STEM, AND 3) EVALUATE WHETHER A VALIDATING NUDGE CAN PROMPT STUDENTS TO TAKE UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENROLL IN THE BRIDGE2BSTEM WORKSHOP AND, SUBSEQUENTLY, BSTEM MATH COURSES. THE FIRST PROJECT AIM WILL BE FULFILLED USING DESCRIPTIVE QUANTITATIVE METHODS TO EXAMINE RACIAL/ETHNIC, GENDER, AND SOCIOECONOMIC TRENDS IN BSTEM AND SLAM COURSES OVER TIME. THE SECOND PROJECT AIM WILL BE FULFILLED THROUGH THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE RESEARCH TEAM AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SITE FOR THE STUDY. THE THIRD PROJECT AIM WILL BE FULFILLED USING EXPERIMENTAL METHODS, SPECIFICALLY THROUGH SECTION-LEVEL RANDOMIZATION OF COLLEGE STATISTICS COURSES AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SITE. A QUALITATIVE STUDY THAT CAPTURES MATH INSTRUCTOR AND COUNSELOR PERSPECTIVES, WORKSHOP OBSERVATIONS, AND STUDENT EXPERIENCES IN THE PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE NUANCED INSIGHTS INTO PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION. THE PROJECT WILL RESULT IN ACCESSIBLE PRACTICE AND POLICY BRIEFS DESCRIBING THE VALIDATING NUDGE AND BRIDGE2BSTEM WORKSHOP, AS WELL AS THE RESULTS OF THE EVALUATION AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE PROJECT WILL ADDITIONALLY RESULT IN ACADEMIC PAPERS DESCRIBING THE ANALYSES AND RESULTS. THIS PROJECT SHOULD CONTRIBUTE NEW KNOWLEDGE ON THE EQUITY IMPLICATIONS OF OFFERING MULTIPLE MATH PATHWAYS AND PROPOSE STRUCTURES AND SUPPORTS THAT CAN INCREASE REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN, RACIALLY MINORITIZED, FIRST-GENERATION, AND LOW-INCOME STUDENTS IN STEM.

CARBONATE MINERAL PRODUCTION IN THE OCEAN CONNECTS THESE IMPORTANT CARBON POOLS AND IS A KEY PROCESS IN THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE. MARINE FISH RELEASE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CARBONATE MINERALS AND ORGANIC CARBON TO THE OCEANS EACH YEAR. YET THE ROLE OF MARINE FISH IN THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE REMAINS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS ROLE, THIS PROJECT WILL STUDY CARBONATE MINERALS PRODUCED BY SEVERAL SPECIES OF MARINE FISH, INCLUDING DEEP SEA AND OPEN OCEAN FISH SPECIES. RESULTS FROM THE STUDY WILL IMPROVE ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNT AND COMPOSITION OF CARBONATE THAT MARINE FISH PRODUCE EACH YEAR. THE PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL NEW INSIGHTS ABOUT THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE OCEANS, MARINE FISH, AND THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE. THIS PROJECT SUPPORTS THE WORK OF AN EARLY CAREER FEMALE SCIENTIST.

GRADUATE STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE IN-DEPTH TRAINING ON SCIENCE WRITING THROUGH A WEEK-LONG WORKSHOP WITH A PROFESSIONAL WRITER. SCIENTISTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT WILL HOST WORKSHOPS WITH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. TEACHING MATERIALS AND SCIENTIFIC RESULTS WILL BE SHARED THROUGH OPEN-ACCESS ONLINE REPOSITORIES, ANNUAL OUTREACH EVENTS, SOCIAL MEDIA, AS WELL AS PROFESSIONAL CONFERENCES AND PUBLICATIONS. MARINE BONY FISH WERE INITIALLY ESTIMATED TO CONTRIBUTE 3-15% OF GLOBAL NEW CARBONATE PRODUCTION IN THE OCEANS EACH YEAR, MAKING FISH A FUNDAMENTAL INFLUENCE ON THE OCEANIC ALKALINITY BUDGET AND EARTH?S GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE. HOWEVER, TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT HAS SHOWN THAT GLOBAL FISH BIOMASS IS LIKELY TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN PREVIOUSLY APPRECIATED, AND THE IMPACT OF THIS INCREASED FISH BIOMASS ON GLOBAL CARBONATE PRODUCTION RATES HAS YET TO BE EVALUATED. SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE GAPS REGARDING THE COMPOSITION OF FISH CONTRIBUTIONS COUPLED WITH UNCERTAINTY REGARDING PRODUCTION MAGNITUDE CURRENTLY PRECLUDE THEIR INCLUSION IN FULLY COUPLED CARBON-CLIMATE MODELS. THIS PROJECT WILL ADDRESS THESE KNOWLEDGE GAPS BY REFINING PRODUCTION RATE ESTIMATES AND CONDUCTING DETAILED COMPOSITIONAL ANALYSES OF CARBONATE MINERALS (ICHTHYOCARBONATE) PRODUCED BY SEVERAL SPECIES OF MARINE FISH, INCLUDING FAST-SWIMMING EPIPELAGIC AND MESOPELAGIC SPECIES. SCIENTISTS INVOLVED IN THIS STUDY WILL CONDUCT A SERIES OF CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTS TO CONSTRAIN PRODUCTION RATE UNDER VARYING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND WILL EMPLOY A STABLE CARBON ISOTOPE MASS BALANCE TO DEFINE THE ORIGIN OF CARBON IN ICHTHYOCARBONATE, INCLUDING DIETARY CARBON AND DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON IN SEAWATER. THE STUDY WILL PROVIDE SCALABLE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN METABOLIC RATE, ICHTHYOCARBONATE PRODUCTION RATE, AND THE INCORPORATION OF DIETARY CARBON INTO ICHTHYOCARBONATE. THE STUDY WILL USE AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF CARBON CYCLING BETWEEN THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE OCEANS DRIVEN BY MARINE FISH.

THIS HELPED MAKE RIGOROUS MANY CALCULATIONS IN CALCULUS AND PHYSICS INVOLVING INTEGRALS OF FUNCTIONS DEFINED ON SPACES WITH ?HOLES.? HOMOLOGY GIVES AN ALGEBRAIC MEASURE OF HOLES IN GEOMETRIC OBJECTS, ALLOWING ALGEBRAIC TECHNIQUES TO GIVE GEOMETRIC INFORMATION, FOR EXAMPLE, SHOWING THAT A GIVEN GEOMETRIC OBJECT CANNOT BE DEFORMED INTO ANOTHER ONE. THE AIM OF THIS PROJECT IS TO STUDY PATTERNS IN THE HOMOLOGY OF FAMILIES OF SPACES COMING FROM NUMBER THEORY AND GEOMETRY. THESE PATTERNS SIMPLIFY HOMOLOGY CALCULATIONS BY REDUCING INFINITE CALCULATIONS TO FINITE CALCULATIONS. IN THIS PROJECT, NEW METHODS INVOLVING THE USE OF COMPUTERS IN THEORETICAL ALGEBRAIC TOPOLOGY AND NUMBER THEORY WILL BE DEVELOPED. THE PROJECT WILL ENHANCE GRADUATE AND POSTDOCTORAL TRAINING IN ALGEBRAIC TOPOLOGY THROUGH MENTORING, SEMINARS, AND CONFERENCES. THE PI WILL PROMOTE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN A SUMMER BRIDGE PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS TO BETTER PREPARE THEM FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE HOMOLOGY OF ARITHMETIC GROUPS, A CENTRAL CONCEPT IN NUMBER THEORY, ALGEBRAIC K-THEORY, AND EVEN THE THEORY OF MANIFOLDS. IN HIGH DIMENSIONS, THE HOMOLOGY IS KNOWN TO VANISH, AND, IN LOW DIMENSIONS, THE HOMOLOGY IS KNOWN TO STABILIZE. THESE STABLE HOMOLOGY GROUPS HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY CALCULATED IN MANY CASES. THE PROJECT FOCUSES ON TWO RANGES OF DIMENSIONS: JUST BELOW WHERE THE HOMOLOGY IS KNOWN TO VANISH AND JUST ABOVE THE STABLE RANGE. CONJECTURALLY, THE HIGHEST DEGREE HOMOLOGY GROUPS SHOULD EXHIBIT A PATTERN CALLED ?EXTREMAL STABILITY? AND THE HOMOLOGY NEAR THE STABLE RANGE SHOULD EXHIBIT A DIFFERENT PATTERN CALLED ?SECONDARY STABILITY.? HIGHLY CONNECTED SIMPLICIAL COMPLEXES AND OPERADIC CELLS WILL BE USED TO TRY TO ESTABLISH THESE CONJECTURES. THE CONNECTION WITH ALGEBRAIC K-THEORY WILL BE A KEY POINT OF EMPHASIS WHEN STUDYING THE HOMOLOGY OF ARITHMETIC GROUPS.

SALISH KOOTENAI COLLEGE AND BLACKFEET COMMUNITY COLLEGE ARE BOTH TRIBAL COLLEGES. OVER ITS SIX-YEAR DURATION, THIS PROJECT WILL FUND SCHOLARSHIPS TO 105 UNIQUE FULL-TIME STEM STUDENTS WHO ARE PURSUING ASSOCIATE AND/OR BACHELOR DEGREES IN BIOLOGICAL AND BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS, PHYSICAL SCIENCES, ENGINEERING, COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES, AND/OR NATURAL RESOURCES AND CONSERVATION. FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS IN BACHELOR DEGREE PROGRAMS WILL RECEIVE FOUR-YEAR SCHOLARSHIPS WHILE TRANSFER STUDENTS AND FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS IN ASSOCIATE DEGREE PROGRAMS WILL RECEIVE TWO-YEAR SCHOLARSHIPS. STUDENTS IN THE PROJECT WILL HAVE ACCESS TO A WIDE VARIETY OF SUPPORTS SUCH AS INDIVIDUAL MENTORING FROM STEM FACULTY MEMBERS AND PEERS AND MONTHLY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITH STUDENTS FROM ALL FOUR INSTITUTIONS. ONE OF THE UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE PROGRAM IS THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN FOUR INSTITUTIONS. THIS INCREASED PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND TRIBAL COLLEGES WILL FACILITATE A BIDIRECTIONAL SHARING OF BEST PRACTICES FOR MENTORING, INCLUSIVE INSTRUCTION, AND STUDENT SUPPORT. THE PARTNERSHIP WILL ALSO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH ACCESS TO PEERS AND FACULTY MEMBERS AT THREE OTHER INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE STATE. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO INCREASE STEM DEGREE COMPLETION OF LOW-INCOME, HIGH-ACHIEVING UNDERGRADUATES WITH DEMONSTRATED FINANCIAL NEED. THE AIMS OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO INCREASE THE FIRST-YEAR RETENTION AND GRADUATION RATES FOR EACH STUDENT COHORT, IMPROVE TRANSITION AFTER GRADUATION TO EITHER A STEM CAREER OR FURTHER HIGHER EDUCATION, AND ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ISSUES AND FACTORS IMPACTING ADVANCEMENT ALONG THE ACADEMIC PATHWAY. MONTANA FACES POST-SECONDARY PERSISTENCE CHALLENGES WITH TWO OF ITS LARGEST POPULATION GROUPS: NATIVE AMERICANS AND INDIVIDUALS FROM EXTREMELY RURAL AREAS. EACH GROUP FACES UNIQUE PERSISTENCE CHALLENGES, WITH SOME COMMONALITIES (E.G., STRONG TIES TO FAMILY/LAND, CULTURE SHOCK, STEREOTYPES). STUDENTS WITH POSITIVE STEM-BASED IDENTITIES PERFORM BETTER ACADEMICALLY AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO PERSIST TO EARN A DEGREE AND STAY IN A STEM FIELD. HOWEVER, STEM-BASED IDENTITIES CAN CLASH WITH PERSONAL IDENTITIES, ESPECIALLY FOR STUDENTS FROM MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. THIS PROJECT WILL ADD UNDERSTANDING IN HOW TO DEVELOP INTEGRATED IDENTITIES THAT INCORPORATE STEM IDENTITIES AND PERSONAL/CULTURAL IDENTITIES. TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF INTEGRATED IDENTITIES, THE SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH TEAM WILL USE A MIXED-METHODS DESIGN. FINDINGS WILL BE SYNTHESIZED INTO CULTURALLY-ATTUNED, PLACE-BASED KNOWLEDGE THAT IS USEFUL FOR TEACHING, MENTORSHIP, AND POLICY IN STEM PROGRAMS AT TRIBAL AND NON-TRIBAL COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. THIS PROJECT WILL DISSEMINATE RESEARCH FINDINGS, SUCCESSES, AND LESSONS LEARNED TO APPROPRIATE STAKEHOLDERS VIA LOCAL AND COMMUNITY MEETINGS, PRESENTATIONS AT REGIONAL AND NATIONAL EVENTS, AND PUBLICATIONS IN RELEVANT JOURNALS. THESE DISSEMINATION ACTIVITIES WILL TAKE PLACE ON EACH CAMPUS AND WITHIN COMMUNITIES AS APPROPRIATE (E.G. TRIBAL COUNCIL MEETINGS, COMMUNITY FORUMS, AND CONTRIBUTION TO NEWSLETTERS, WEBSITES, AND OTHER VENUES). THIS PROJECT IS FUNDED BY NSF'S SCHOLARSHIPS IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS PROGRAM, WHICH SEEKS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF LOW-INCOME ACADEMICALLY TALENTED STUDENTS WITH DEMONSTRATED FINANCIAL NEED WHO EARN DEGREES IN STEM FIELDS.

RACIALIZED MATHEMATICS TEACHING PRACTICES ARE SYSTEMIC IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS CLASSROOMS, AND THE IMPACTS OF SYSTEMIC INEQUITIES IN K-12 MATHEMATICS EDUCATION BOTH DETER STUDENTS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS FROM BECOMING INTERESTED IN MATH, REDUCING THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF ENGAGING IN STEM; AND AFFECT STUDENTS? IDENTITIES BY DEVALUING OR ERASING THEIR DIVERSE CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS AND PERSPECTIVES. SINCE TEACHERS ARE THE KEY TO ENSURING RACIAL EQUITY IN CLASSROOMS, IDENTIFYING RACIALIZED MATHEMATICS EXPERIENCES MUST BEGIN WITH MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS. IN THIS INNOVATIVE STUDY, A PROJECT TEAM COMPRISED OF MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATORS OF COLOR (MTECS) WILL COLLABORATE WITH 12-15 PRESERVICE TEACHERS OF COLOR (PTOCS), IN AUTHENTIC PARTNERSHIP, FROM THREE UNIQUE MTEPS (AT AN HBCU, AN HSI, AND A PWI) TO FORM A CROSS-SITE CRITICAL MATHEMATICS PROFESSIONAL LEARNING COMMUNITY (CMPLC). BY DOCUMENTING PTOCS? RACIALIZED MATHEMATICS EXPERIENCES ACROSS THREE SITES, THE PROJECT WILL: (1) GATHER FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE ON THE RACIALIZED MATHEMATICAL LEARNING AND TEACHING EXPERIENCES OF PTOCS, (2) BUILD KNOWLEDGE OF RACIALIZED MATHEMATICS EXPERIENCES AND THEIR OVERALL IMPACT ON THE PREPARATION OF PTOCS, AND (3) INFORM TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS ACROSS CONTENT AND CONTEXTS. AS BLACK AND LATINX SCHOLARS WITH EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN TEACHER EDUCATION, THE PROJECT TEAM CONCEPTUALIZED THIS CREATIVE PROJECT TO ILLUMINATE NEW WAYS OF NOURISHING AND AFFIRMING PTOCS? RACIAL IDENTITIES AND CULTURAL STRENGTHS IN MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATION. THE PROJECT TEAM WILL COLLABORATE WITH PARTICIPATING PTOCS TO ANALYZE DATA GENERATED FROM FOCUS GROUPS, INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS, CMPLC CONVERSATIONS, JOURNALS, AND FIELD NOTES USING INTERPRETATIVE PHENOMENOLOGY ANALYSIS, CASE STUDY METHODOLOGY, AND THEMATIC ANALYSIS. PARTICIPATING PTOCS? STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY THE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE STUDENTS IN THEIR CLASSROOMS, WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS PROJECT BY RECEIVING INCREASED OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN MATHEMATICS IN WAYS THAT BOLSTER THEIR STEM IDENTITIES. THE PROJECT WILL FILL A GAP IN THE RESEARCH LITERATURE BY: (1) INCREASING THE KNOWLEDGE ON THE MATHEMATICS TEACHER PREPARATION OF PTOCS; (2) CENTERING THE VOICES AND EXPERIENCES OF PTOCS AND MATHEMATICS TEACHER EDUCATORS OF COLOR IN A CROSS-RACIAL AND CROSS-CULTURAL PROJECT; AND (3) BRINGING UNIQUE PERSPECTIVES TO THE DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, EVALUATION, AND DISSEMINATION OF FINDINGS ABOUT BOTH OUR OWN EXPERIENCES AND THOSE OF PTOCS, AS A PI TEAM COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF MTECS. BY ATTAINING A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF PTOCS? MATHEMATICS LEARNING EXPERIENCES, WE ADVANCE RACIAL EQUITY BY EXPOSING RACIST TEACHING PRACTICES THAT DISADVANTAGE HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED STUDENTS AND IDENTIFYING CHANGES IN TEACHER EDUCATION THAT WILL IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS PRACTICES THAT OBSTRUCT RACIAL EQUITY IN STEM. THIS COLLABORATIVE PROJECT IS FUNDED THROUGH THE RACIAL EQUITY IN STEM EDUCATION ACTIVITY (EHR RACIAL EQUITY). THE ACTIVITY SUPPORTS RESEARCH AND PRACTICE PROJECTS THAT INVESTIGATE HOW CONSIDERATIONS OF RACIAL EQUITY FACTOR INTO THE IMPROVEMENT OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS (STEM) EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE. AWARDED PROJECTS SEEK TO CENTER THE VOICES, KNOWLEDGE, AND EXPERIENCES OF THE INDIVIDUALS, COMMUNITIES, AND INSTITUTIONS MOST IMPACTED BY SYSTEMIC INEQUITIES WITHIN THE STEM ENTERPRISE.

GAPS EXIST IN UNDERSTANDING HOW A DROUGHT PROPAGATES AND INTENSIFIES ACROSS DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE WATER CYCLE, ESPECIALLY IN SNOWY, MOUNTAINOUS AREAS. SEASONAL SNOWMELT SUPPLIES MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE WESTERN U.S. WITH A SIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF THEIR WATER RESOURCES. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO ADDRESS OPEN QUESTIONS BY CHARACTERIZING THE RATE OF DROUGHT ONSET, ITS DRIVERS, AND HOW THESE FACTORS INFLUENCE DROUGHT IMPACTS. RATES OF PROPAGATION AMONG DIFFERENT TYPES OF DROUGHTS (E.G., A LACK OF SNOW WATER EQUIVALENT [SNOW DROUGHT], STREAMFLOW [HYDROLOGICAL DROUGHT], AND SOIL MOISTURE [AGRICULTURAL DROUGHT]) WILL BE QUANTIFIED. THE SEVERITY, DURATION, TIMING, AND INTENSIFICATION RATE OF HOW ONE TYPE OF DROUGHT INFLUENCES THE CHARACTERISTICS AND LAG OF ANOTHER WILL BE STUDIED. HOW THESE RELATIONSHIPS VARY IN SPACE AND TIME USING STATE-OF-THE-ART DATA, MODELS, AND OBSERVATIONS WILL BE ELUCIDATED. FINDINGS FROM THIS RESEARCH ARE TARGETED TO HELP BUILD MORE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES, DEVELOPING CLIMATE RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND MANAGING WATER RESOURCES IN AREAS WHERE SNOW IS A VITAL FRESHWATER RESOURCE. THE PROJECT WILL DEVELOP A NEW MULTIVARIATE FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING DROUGHT CHARACTERISTICS AND PROPAGATION IN SNOWY AREAS. INVESTIGATING THE IMPACT OF SNOW VARIABILITY, DRIVERS OF DROUGHT, AND THE RATE OF DROUGHT ONSET WILL INFORM WATER MANAGEMENT AND DROUGHT MONITORING. GIVEN THE LAG BETWEEN SNOW AND STREAMFLOW DEFICITS, THIS ANALYSIS AIMS TO YIELD INSIGHT INTO DROUGHT PREDICTION. THE PROJECT WILL ASSESS HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT THE ONSET RATE, DRIVERS OF SNOW DROUGHT, AND ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS WILL INFLUENCE THE AMOUNT OF WATER IN OTHER STATES/FLUXES (E.G., SOIL MOISTURE, RUNOFF). ALSO, NEW MULTIVARIATE DROUGHT INDICES FROM THIS RESEARCH WILL ENABLE QUANTIFICATION OF DROUGHT SEVERITY IN SNOWY AREAS ACROSS THE GLOBE, WHICH WILL BE CRITICAL IN A WARMING CLIMATE. FINDINGS AND METHODS ARE EXPECTED TO IMPROVE STREAMFLOW FORECASTS, SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND ENGINEERING, AND DROUGHT ASSESSMENT AT SUB-SEASONAL AND INTERANNUAL TIME SCALES. RESULTS WILL BE SHARED WITH THE BROADER COMMUNITY VIA PRESENTATIONS AT SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS, PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL PUBLICATIONS, AND ONLINE DATA REPOSITORIES (E.G., CUAHSI?S HYDROSHARE). SINCE SNOW AND DROUGHT IMPACT NUMEROUS AREAS BEYOND WATER MANAGEMENT AND ENGINEERING, FINDINGS SHOULD IMPACT OTHER SECTORS OF SOCIETY AND GUIDE DECISION MAKING IN AGRICULTURE, ECONOMICS, AND URBAN PLANNING. THE MULTIVARIATE DROUGHT FRAMEWORKS FROM THIS RESEARCH WILL BE FREELY PROVIDED TO THE PUBLIC SO WATER AGENCIES, SCIENTISTS, AND ENGINEERS CAN BENEFIT FROM THEIR APPLICATION.

PREVIOUS STUDIES IN THE MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS, ANTARCTICA SUGGEST THAT VIRAL INFECTIONS OF MICROBES, AND A GENERAL LACK OF FERTILIZERS (I.E., NUTRIENTS), MAY BE IMPORTANT FACTORS SHAPING THE DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTIONING OF MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES IN CRYOCONITE HOLES. THE RESEARCHERS PROPOSE AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH TO UNDERSTAND HOW NUTRIENT LIMITATION AFFECTS DIVERSITY (NUMBER OF SPECIES) AND OVERALL ABUNDANCE OF MICROBES, AND HOW THE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF MICROBES IN TURN AFFECTS THE DIVERSITY, ABUNDANCE, AND INFECTION TYPE OF VIRUSES THAT PARASITIZE THE MICROBES IN CRYOCONITE SEDIMENTS.

COASTAL CITIES NEED TO PREPARE FOR THESE CHALLENGES BY BOOSTING THE RESILIENCE OF BOTH PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURES. THIS SAI PROJECT INVESTIGATES HOW ENGAGING COMMUNITIES DIRECTLY IN STORMWATER MANAGEMENT COULD HELP TO MAKE PROPERTY AND INFRASTRUCTURES MORE RESILIENT. A SPECIAL FOCUS OF THE RESEARCH IS HOW COASTAL COMMUNITIES CAN MAKE THE BEST USE OF GREEN STORMWATER INFRASTRUCTURE, WHERE NATURAL PROCESSES HELP COMMUNITIES TO MANAGE STORMWATER MORE EFFECTIVELY. THE RESEARCH EXPLORES TWO INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE UPON CONVENTIONAL STORMWATER INFRASTRUCTURE APPROACHES. ONE IS TO INCREASE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURAL DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND MAINTENANCE PROCESSES (INFRASTRUCTURAL CITIZENSHIP). THIS IMPROVES STORMWATER INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGN BY HARNESSING LOCAL KNOWLEDGE OF FLOOD RISKS AND ENGAGING A BROADER RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS IN THE IMAGINATION OF POSSIBLE SOCIAL SOLUTIONS. THE OTHER IS TO UTILIZE THE POTENTIAL OF GREEN STORMWATER INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS RAIN GARDENS, BIOSWALES, AND GREEN DETENTION/RETENTION BASINS. THIS CREATES MORE FREQUENT, AFFORDABLE, AND SUBSTANTIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CIVIC ENGAGEMENT THAN CONVENTIONAL STORMWATER INFRASTRUCTURE. WITH A CONVERGENCE OF EXPERTISE IN ANTHROPOLOGY, URBAN DESIGN, AND CIVIL ENGINEERING, THE PROJECT INCLUDES FIELD RESEARCH, PARTICIPATORY DESIGN WORK AND HYDROLOGICAL IMPACT ANALYSIS IN THREE DEMOGRAPHICALLY DISTINCT, FLOOD PRONE HOUSTON, TX NEIGHBORHOODS. THE PROJECT AIMS TO PRODUCE INNOVATIVE PORTABLE AND ACTIONABLE URBAN DESIGNS THAT CAN GUIDE STORMWATER INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES IN HOUSTON, TX AND BEYOND.

DEVELOPMENTAL GENE REGULATION IS LARGELY MADE POSSIBLE BY MANY PROTEIN COMPLEXES THAT TURN GENES ON OR OFF AT APPROPRIATE DEVELOPMENTAL WINDOWS. AN IMPORTANT EXAMPLE IS THE POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX, WHICH TURNS OFF A SPECIFIC SET OF DEVELOPMENTAL GENES. HOW THIS COMPLEX SELECTS THE CORRECT GENES TO SILENCE DURING EARLY DEVELOPMENT IS STILL UNKNOWN. THIS PROJECT WILL UTILIZE THE FRUIT FLY AS MODEL ORGANISM TO STUDY THE ROLE OF THIS SILENCING COMPLEX IN ORCHESTRATING DEVELOPMENTAL GENE EXPRESSION. DISCOVERING THE MECHANISM BY WHICH POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEXES SILENCE GENES IN THE FRUIT FLY WILL INFORM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF DEVELOPMENT IN MAMMALS. ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO INCREASE THE PARTICIPATION OF PERSONS TRADITIONALLY EXCLUDED BECAUSE OF THEIR ETHNICITY OR RACE (PEERS) IN UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH EXPERIENCES AT EMMANUEL COLLEGE. STUDENT RESEARCHERS WILL USE GENETIC, MOLECULAR, AND BIOCHEMICAL TECHNIQUES TO ADDRESS THE AIMS OF THIS PROJECT. COLLABORATIONS WITH RESEARCHERS FROM HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL AND BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY WILL FACILITATE ENGAGEMENT OF PEER UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITH THE BROADER SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY. THE GOAL IS TO INSPIRE LARGER NUMBERS OF PEER STUDENTS TO PURSUE CAREERS IN STEM. MULTICELLULAR DEVELOPMENT IS GOVERNED BY THE DEPLOYMENT OF CELL-TYPE SPECIFIC TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROGRAMMING, IN WHICH A SINGLE GENOME IS UTILIZED DISTINCTLY OVER TIME AND SPACE AS CELLS MULTIPLY AND SPECIALIZE. THIS PHENOMENON IS ACHIEVED BY THE PRECISE COORDINATION OF GENE EXPRESSION THAT INITIATES THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE DIFFERENT CELL TYPES OF AN ORGANISM. CHROMATIN REGULATORY FACTORS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE ESSENTIAL FOR REGULATION OF DEVELOPMENTAL TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROGRAMMING HOWEVER THE MECHANISM BEHIND HOW THESE FACTORS COORDINATE GENE EXPRESSION DURING EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT REMAINS UNCLEAR. ONE HIGHLY CONSERVED CHROMATIN REGULATORY SYSTEM THAT PLAYS A CENTRAL ROLE IN DEVELOPMENTAL PATTERNING AND CELL DIFFERENTIATION INCLUDES THE POLYCOMB GROUP (PCG) PROTEINS. THESE PROTEINS ARE TYPICALLY FOUND IN TWO DISTINCT TYPES OF POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEXES (PRCS): PRC1 AND PRC2. THE PI'S LAB RECENTLY IDENTIFIED VARIANT PRC1 (VPRC1) COMPLEXES IN DROSOPHILA THAT HAVE STRONG MODULAR CONSERVATION WITH MAMMALIAN COMPLEXES, SUGGESTING AN ANCIENT FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY. THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF VPRC1 COMPLEXES IN COORDINATING THE CELL-TYPE SPECIFIC TRANSCRIPTION CRITICAL FOR NORMAL DEVELOPMENT. IN THIS PROJECT, UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT SCIENTISTS WILL FUNCTIONALLY CHARACTERIZE ONE OF THE VPRC1 COMPLEXES USING A VARIETY OF METHODS, INCLUDING CROSSLINKING, TANDEM AFFINITY PURIFICATION, AND INTEGRATED ANALYSIS OF PROTEIN PARTNERS AND DNA BINDING SITES, IN PARALLEL WITH FUNCTIONAL GENETIC APPROACHES TO DISSECT THE CHANGES IN PROTEIN COMPLEXES DURING NORMAL DEVELOPMENT IN DROSOPHILA. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL PROVIDE MECHANISTIC DETAILS FOR FUNCTION OF A VARIANT PRC1 COMPLEX IN DEVELOPMENTAL GENE REGULATION.

ECOTOURISM IS PARTICULARLY PROMISING TO HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES WHO POSSESS DEEP CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE AND UNIQUE ECOLOGICAL FEATURES AND SEEK AVENUES OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT THAT HONOR THAT CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE AND PRESERVE THOSE RESOURCES. HOW DO COMMUNITY MEMBERS INVOLVED WITH ECOTOURISM DEVELOPMENT MAKE CHOICES ABOUT THE ELEMENTS OF THEIR CULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT THEY EMPHASIZE TO VISITORS? ARE ECOTOURISM PROGRAMS REFLECTIVE OF BROADER COMMUNITY IDEALS AND IDENTITY, AND HOW DO THESE PERSPECTIVES VARY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY? THIS DOCTORAL DISSERTATION RESEARCH EXPLORES THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN ECOTOURISM DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL RESILIENCE IN A NORTH AMERICAN INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY. THE RESEARCH TESTS THE APPLICABILITY OF THEORIES ON SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL RESILIENCE USED ACROSS DISCIPLINES DEALING WITH HUMAN-ENVIRONMENT RELATIONS TO INDIGENOUS CONTEXTS. IT ALSO TRAINS A DOCTORAL DISSERTATION STUDENT IN THEORY AND METHODS IN CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY AND THE WORK WILL BE DISTRIBUTED BROADLY TO ACADEMIC AUDIENCES, COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS, AND THE PUBLIC.

WHILE PRIOR RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED INCREASED LEARNING GAINS AND OTHER BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES FOR LAS AND STUDENTS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO FULLY CHARACTERIZE WHAT HAPPENS ON THE GROUND THAT LEADS TO SUCH EXCITING LEARNING GAINS, AND TO INSTITUTIONALIZE KEY ASPECTS OF THESE PROGRAMS. IN THIS PROJECT, THE RESEARCHERS PLAN TO STUDY HOW THE NEW SUPPORT STRUCTURES FOR FACULTY OFFERED BY THE PROJECT ENABLE NEW KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS TO FORM BETWEEN LAS AND FACULTY. THEY WILL THEN MODEL HOW THOSE RELATIONSHIPS LEAD TO SHIFTS IN LA AND FACULTY BELIEFS ABOUT TEACHING AND LEARNING, AND EXAMINE WHICH PROGRAMMATIC ELEMENTS ARE NECESSARY FOR INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATION. LA PROGRAMS NECESSARILY REQUIRE INVOLVEMENT OF MANY STAKEHOLDERS, WHICH MAKES THEM CHALLENGING TO INSTITUTIONALIZE. THEREFORE THE PROJECT INCLUDES THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO COLLABORATE WITH NECESSARY ADMINISTRATORS AND LEARNING CENTERS IN ADDITION TO FACULTY (TENURE- AND NON-TENURE TRACK) AND STUDENTS TO IDENTIFY BARRIERS AND AVENUES TO INSTITUTIONALIZED CHANGE.
